# Developer Environment Design

## Implementation Summary

This document outlines the design decisions for our developer environment setup.

## Architecture Implemented

### User Setup
- **Developer User**: `developer` (non-root with limited sudo)
- **Directory Structure**: `/home/developer/workspace/` for development, `/var/www/api/` for production
- **Group Membership**: `www-data` group for production file access

### Development Workflow  
- **Hot Reload**: Air for development on port 8081
- **Production Deploy**: One-command deployment with `deploy` script
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/prod configurations

### Security Model
- **Limited Sudo**: Only API service management commands
- **File Permissions**: Read/write workspace, group access to production
- **SSH Access**: Key-based authentication only

### Tools Provided
- **Go 1.23.4** with complete development environment
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automated build, test, deploy, rollback
- **Helper Aliases**: Quick commands for common tasks
